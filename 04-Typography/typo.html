    <h2>All reasons you should watch this movie:</h2>
    <p>
      It's about this clumsy, noodle-loving panda named Po who dreams of becoming a Kung Fu master.
      Even though he um....doesn't exactly look like a person who can do kung fu, he gets chosen to be the
    Dragon Warrior and has to train
      with the Furious Five, who are the coolest Kung Fu masters ever!
    </p>
    <p>
      The characters are so fun and inspiring. Po is super funny, but also really brave and kind-hearted.
      Master Shifu is a wise and strict teacher who helps Po believe in himself. And the Furious Five‚ÄîTigress,
      Monkey, Mantis, Viper, and Crane‚Äîare all awesome in their own ways and show that teamwork is super important.
